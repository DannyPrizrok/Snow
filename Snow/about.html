                <span class="block__subtitle">
                    Founded in 2018, Snow embarked on a visionary journey, fueled by a
                    passion for design excellence. From our inception, we set out to redefine spaces through a
                    harmonious blend of innovation and meticulous craftsmanship.

                    In 2020, our founders envisioned more than a furniture brand — they envisioned an immersive
                    experience where each piece tells a story of dedication and timeless elegance. Our commitment to
                    excellence has evolved over the years, making Snow synonymous with superior quality
                    and design mastery.

                    Fast forward to the present, where Snow stands as a testament to our journey. Every
                    creation is a reflection of years of dedication, precision, and an unwavering commitment to
                    delivering not just furniture but elevated lifestyles.

                        In 2019, Snow introduced its inaugural design—an exceptional chair that quickly
                        became a standout bestseller. This iconic creation not only marked our entry into the world of
                        furniture but also established a benchmark for design excellence. Meticulously crafted for both
                        aesthetics and comfort, the chair resonated with our clientele, reflecting our commitment to
                        quality. Its widespread popularity wasn't just a testament to its visual appeal but also to the
                        enduring principles of craftsmanship embedded in every detail. This chair remains an enduring
                        symbol of Snow's dedication to creating timeless, beloved pieces that transcend
                        trends and captivate discerning tastes.</span>
